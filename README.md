# 10 Year Anniversary

I did not expect the interest in this project to continue for so long! With that, I have rebuilt most of the project in a modern stack.

Originally I created this as I was craving the nostalgia of the "MyCoke Music Mixer" and "Coke Studios Music Mixer", a game I used to play in the early 2000s.
